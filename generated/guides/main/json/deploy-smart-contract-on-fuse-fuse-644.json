Written in JavaScript, Remix supports both usage in the browser and locally.\n\nRemix also supports testing, debugging, and deploying smart contracts and much more.\n Pre-requisites:\n\nSince we interact with Remix using Metamask, you need to change the network to a Fuse network by adding a custom RPC. Please follow the steps in this tutorial to do that.\n\nYou need to have a small balance of FUSE on the Fusenet wallet you are using which will be used as Gas for the transactions.        ",
