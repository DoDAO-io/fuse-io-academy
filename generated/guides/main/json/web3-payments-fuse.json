In the new age of the web, known as Web3, decentralized internet applications are built on a blockchain network. Web3 payments allow users to send, receive, and store digital assets securely without the need for intermediaries like banks or payment processors. These payments are entirely peer-to-peer and are built on trustless logical systems, meaning that no one has to rely on a third party to facilitate the transaction.",
