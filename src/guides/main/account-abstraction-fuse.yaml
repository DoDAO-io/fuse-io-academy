      In the ever-evolving landscape of cryptocurrencies, one concept has
      garnered significant attention and acclaim: Account Abstraction. This
      groundbreaking development has the potential to propel cryptocurrencies
      from niche status to mainstream adoption by enhancing the programmability
      of user accounts. 


      By unifying Contract Accounts and Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs), while
      eliminating redundant logic, account abstraction represents a significant
      leap forward for the entire crypto industry.


      More importantly, it means the nascent blockchain industry is approaching
      a crucial moment regarding useability for everyone. At the same time, it’s
      a pivotal moment for Fuse as the world catches up with our original value
      proposition of taking Web3 payments mainstream and changing how people
      interact with money. 


      This guide lets you learn about our journey of pioneering this technology
      since 2019 and our imminent plans regarding implementing account
      abstraction. In this guide, we want to outline what account abstraction
      is, how it works, and, most importantly, delve into its benefits to
      developers in the Fuse and broader EVM ecosystem.
