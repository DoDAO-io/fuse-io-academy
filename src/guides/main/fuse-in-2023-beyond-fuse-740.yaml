      Fuse has made significant progress in 2023 and has exciting updates and
      announcements to share. Over the past three years, Fuse has focused on
      improving the user experience by deploying robust middleware. This
      includes a relay service, contract wallets, and a back-end specifically
      designed to enhance the experience for non-crypto native users. Fuse has
      deployed over 180K contract wallets to scale these accounts and prepare
      for future users.


      Unlike many other projects, Fuse aims to focus on mainstream adoption use
      cases that do not require users to become crypto investors. They offer
      gasless transactions and other features to make it easier for non-crypto
      users to take advantage of Web3 technology. With the release of ERC-4337,
      Fuse aims to decentralize its middleware and maintain interoperability
      with larger blockchain ecosystems. This move has led to collaborations
      with Power Validators and ERC4337 partners, solidifying Fuse as a tech
      powerhouse.


      Fuse is also introducing a sandbox environment for Spark, allowing users
      to experiment with the product. They are migrating their legacy middleware
      and upgrading smart contracts to align with the ERC-4337 standard. This
      will enable the migration of existing Operators to the new standard and
      combine the upgraded backend services with a user-friendly interface
      called the "FuseBox."


      In terms of tokenomics, Fuse is transitioning from an inflationary to a
      deflationary model. They have suggested a maximum supply of 400 million
      FUSE tokens and will gradually reduce inflation while initiating a base
      fee burn. These changes will be executed soon, and the Fuse Forum is the
      place to learn more about the approved tokenomics changes.


      Fuse has been actively engaging with Operators, refining marketing and
      sales strategies, and forming partnerships. They have successfully
      partnered with Peepl, Bitazza, Chromepay, Zneakrz, and Sanduk, among
      others. In May 2023, they launched the Fuse Ignite Program, a $10M fund
      dedicated to empowering real-world and DeFi builders to advance the
      adoption of Web3 payments. This program has generated positive feedback
      and quality leads globally.


      Fuse has also been active in local and global events, discussing
      regulatory implications, lecturing at academic institutions, and
      participating in hackathons. They were even selected to present at the
      Google Web3 Community event. Fuse believes in transparency and inclusion
      and will continue to share updates as they move forward with their
      mission.


      In summary, Fuse has made significant strides in 2023 and beyond. They
      have focused on improving the user experience, decentralizing their
      middleware, and transitioning to a deflationary model. They have formed
      partnerships, launched a funding program, and actively participated in
      events and discussions. Fuse is committed to mainstream adoption and
      making Web3 technology accessible to all users.
