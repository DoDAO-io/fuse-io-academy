      Fuse Network is a payment-focused blockchain ecosystem that aims to become
      more robust and decentralized. To achieve this, the Fuse ecosystem has
      outlined three core entities: Merchants, Operators, and Power Validators.
      As a Layer-1 blockchain, Fuse does not depend on any other blockchain for
      finalizing transactions, making it a reliable and independent network.


      Merchants play a crucial role in the Fuse ecosystem. They can easily
      integrate decentralized payment services provided by Operators into their
      existing applications. This allows them to quickly start accepting
      payments and conducting business on the Fuse Network. Merchants can also
      utilize out-of-the-box services such as accounting, invoicing, point of
      sale, and eCommerce plugins, making it convenient for them to manage their
      operations.


      Operators are the backbone of the decentralized middleware layer on the
      Fuse Network. They can be real-world businesses, applications, games, or
      anything that can run on the Fuse blockchain. Operators are responsible
      for onboarding users to applications on Fuse and ensuring compliance with
      local regulations. They build products and services that utilize the Fuse
      Network for their clients, providing critical services to make
      applications run smoothly.


      Power Validators are essential for achieving decentralization on the Fuse
      Network. They power the payment infrastructure of the platform and
      actively validate transactions. Their role is crucial in ensuring the
      desired level of decentralization that makes sense for businesses. Power
      Validators also run sequencer nodes that commit transactions in batches to
      the Fuse Network, contributing to its scalability and fault tolerance.


      Fuse Network offers a full-stack solution, unlike many other networks that
      rely on Ethereum infrastructure. It provides businesses with everything
      they need to access the Fuse Network, making it a compelling option for
      developers looking to build decentralized applications and smart
      contracts. Being a Layer-1 blockchain, Fuse has the flexibility to focus
      on its desired vertical and not follow the path set by Ethereum
      development.


      In the coming year, Fuse aims to onboard more Operators, enhance privacy,
      and further decentralize its ecosystem. By implementing Skandha Bundler,
      Fuse becomes an Account Abstraction compatible EVM chain, adding more
      functionality and compatibility to its network. Fuse was designed to be
      user-friendly for both blockchain and non-blockchain developers, making it
      accessible to a wide range of users and businesses.
