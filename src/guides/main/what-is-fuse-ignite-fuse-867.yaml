      Fuse Ignite is a funding program launched by Fuse with a budget of over
      $10 million. The program aims to stimulate growth and innovation in
      various areas of the Fuse ecosystem. It is structured around two main
      areas: liquidity incentives and developer grants. 


      The liquidity incentives program is designed to increase the total value
      locked (TVL) and the number of token holders on bridged chains. It also
      aims to increase the number of stakers on Fuse and the number of active
      validators. This program provides on-chain DeFi incentives to support the
      growth and expansion of DeFi projects.


      On the other hand, the developer grants program coincides with the
      deployment of a launchpad on Fuse. The company will provide grants of
      around $25K to approximately ten projects throughout the rest of 2023. The
      focus of this program is on real-world operators who leverage Web3
      payments for mainstream business adoption.


      The goal of Fuse Ignite is to unshackle businesses from outdated,
      pre-internet technology. Fuse aims to achieve this by investing in teams
      and projects that align with their mission. They are looking for projects
      and technologies that the community can support and interact with, as well
      as projects that solve basic necessities or add economic value to the
      ecosystem.


      Fuse Ignite is set up to accommodate two groups of builders. The first
      group consists of those who want to build DeFi and Web3 payment
      applications. The liquidity incentives program provides on-chain
      incentives to support their projects' growth and expansion. The second
      group consists of companies that want to leverage their software to build
      a SaaS business model on Fuse. They aim to become the decentralized middle
      layer that facilitates business operations.


      By participating in the Fuse Ignite program, builders can benefit from
      technical assistance and resources from Fuse's team of experts. They also
      gain increased exposure and visibility within the Fuse ecosystem,
      potential partnerships and collaborations with other projects and
      businesses, and the opportunity to be part of an ecosystem focused on
      practical and sustainable applications of Web3.


      Overall, Fuse Ignite is a funding program that aims to drive business
      adoption of Web3 payments. It provides liquidity incentives and developer
      grants to support the growth and innovation of projects in the Fuse
      ecosystem. By investing in teams and projects that align with their
      mission, Fuse aims to unshackle businesses from outdated technology and
      bring Web3 payments to mainstream adoption.
