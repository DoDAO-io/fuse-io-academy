      Fuse Network is a decentralized blockchain platform that was created in
      2019 with the goal of providing easy access to Web3 features for
      businesses and entrepreneurs. It is designed to be enterprise-grade,
      reliable, and secure, making it suitable for a wide range of use cases.
      One of the key advantages of Fuse Network is its low gas fees, which
      average around $0.001 per transaction. Additionally, transaction speeds on
      the network are very fast, with an average time of below 5 seconds.


      The Fuse Blockchain is open to anyone who wants to build on it, whether
      they are existing crypto projects, start-ups, or blue-chip companies. It
      offers a range of enterprise-ready, decentralized technologies that can be
      leveraged to create and scale Web3 applications. The network also provides
      a native marketplace for decentralized services, which is run by the
      community. This marketplace is complemented by a mobile-first SDK that
      allows businesses to quickly bring their Web3 ideas to life.


      Fuse Network is particularly well-suited for entrepreneurs and
      organizations that want to experiment, launch, and scale Web3 apps. It
      offers a robust and secure blockchain infrastructure platform that is
      capable of handling enterprise-grade, production-ready applications. The
      network's low fees and fast transaction speeds make it an attractive
      option for businesses looking for a scalable blockchain solution.
      Additionally, the Fuse SDK allows companies to easily integrate Web3
      services and crypto payments into their existing mobile products,
      eliminating the complexities of Web3 development.


      The utility token of the Fuse Network is called Fuse Token (FUSE), which
      is an ERC-20 token. It can be used as a medium of exchange and as payment
      to the Fuse Network to approve transactions. Additionally, it can be used
      to participate in the network's staking mechanism. The Fuse ecosystem is
      supported by over 100 decentralized service providers, offering a wide
      range of tools and services such as token bridges, decentralized
      exchanges, NFT marketplaces, fiat on-ramps, and DID identifiers. This
      provides project teams and startups with all the necessary resources to
      build and scale dApps on an EVM-compatible blockchain.


      In order to enhance its capabilities, Fuse Network has implemented Skandha
      Bundler, a technology that brings Account Abstraction to the network. This
      makes Fuse an Account Abstraction compatible EVM chain, further expanding
      its functionality and compatibility with other blockchain systems.
      Overall, Fuse Network offers a user-friendly and accessible platform for
      businesses and entrepreneurs to leverage the power of Web3 and build
      innovative decentralized applications.
