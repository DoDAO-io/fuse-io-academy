      Voltage Finance is a platform that provides a range of DeFi tools that can
      be accessed easily on any smart device. One of the main features of
      Voltage Finance is its Automated Market Maker (AMM) exchange. This allows
      users to trade between different tokens using an automated system, making
      the process quick and efficient.


      Another feature offered by Voltage Finance is Liquidity Pools. Users can
      stake LP tokens into Farms and in return, they can earn VOLT and wFUSE
      tokens. This provides an opportunity for users to earn passive income by
      providing liquidity to the platform.


      Yield Farming is another option available on Voltage Finance. Users can
      stake their VOLT tokens and receive veVOLT tokens. These veVOLT tokens not
      only grant governance power to the users but also entitle them to a share
      of the revenue generated by Voltage, which is distributed in VOLT. This
      allows users to participate in the platform's growth and earn rewards.


      Additionally, Voltage Finance offers the option to stake FUSE with liquid
      staking (sFUSE). By staking FUSE, users can benefit from a high Annual
      Percentage Yield (APY) in FUSE. This feature also provides the opportunity
      for auto-compounding, which means that users can continuously reinvest
      their earnings to maximize their returns. Moreover, staked tokens can be
      used to participate in other DeFi opportunities within the Voltage Finance
      ecosystem.


      In summary, Voltage Finance provides a range of DeFi tools that can be
      accessed easily on any smart device. Users can trade between tokens using
      the AMM exchange, earn rewards through Liquidity Pools, participate in
      Yield Farming to earn governance power and revenue shares, and stake FUSE
      for high APY and auto-compounding benefits. These features offer users the
      opportunity to grow their assets, earn passive income, and actively
      participate in the DeFi ecosystem.
