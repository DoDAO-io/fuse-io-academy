      Voltage Finance is a platform that provides a range of DeFi tools that can
      be accessed easily on any smart device. One of the main features of
      Voltage Finance is its Automated Market Maker (AMM) exchange. This allows
      users to trade between different tokens using an automated system, making
      the process quick and efficient.


      Another feature offered by Voltage Finance is Liquidity Pools. Users can
      stake LP tokens into Farms and in return, they can earn VOLT and wFUSE
      tokens. This provides an opportunity for users to earn passive income by
      providing liquidity to the platform.


      Yield Farming is another option available on Voltage Finance. Users can
      stake their VOLT tokens and receive veVOLT tokens. These veVOLT tokens not
      only grant governance power to the users but also entitle them to a share
      of the revenue generated by Voltage, which is distributed in VOLT. This
      allows users to participate in the platform's growth and earn rewards.


      Additionally, Voltage Finance offers the option to stake FUSE with liquid
      staking (sFUSE). By staking FUSE, users can benefit from a high Annual
      Percentage Yield (APY) in FUSE. This feature also provides the opportunity
      for auto-compounding, which means that users can continuously reinvest
      their earnings to maximize their returns. Moreover, staked tokens can be
      used to participate in other DeFi opportunities within the Voltage Finance
      ecosystem.


      In summary, Voltage Finance provides a range of DeFi tools that can be
      accessed easily on any smart device. Users can trade between tokens using
      the AMM exchange, earn rewards through Liquidity Pools, participate in
      Yield Farming to earn governance power and revenue shares, and stake FUSE
      for high APY and auto-compounding benefits. These features offer users the
      opportunity to grow their assets, earn passive income, and actively
      participate in the DeFi ecosystem.

      To trade on Voltage DEX, you can use the simple swap interface. All you
      need to do is select the two tokens that you want to exchange. The
      liquidity on the exchange is provided by Liquidity Providers (LPs) who
      stake their tokens in Pools. In return, they receive LP tokens, which can
      also be staked to earn VOLT tokens on the farm.


      When you make a token swap or trade on the exchange, you will have to pay
      a trading fee. This fee helps to support the platform and maintain its
      operations. Additionally, Voltage DEX offers a StableSwap integration,
      which allows users to swap between stablecoins with low to 0% slippage.
      This feature provides a convenient and efficient way to trade stablecoins.


      In summary, trading on Voltage DEX is a straightforward process. You
      simply select the two tokens you want to exchange and make the trade. The
      liquidity on the platform is provided by LPs who stake their tokens in
      Pools. When you trade, you will pay a trading fee, and there is also a
      StableSwap integration available for trading stablecoins. Overall, Voltage
      DEX offers a user-friendly and efficient trading experience for
      cryptocurrency traders.

      Yield farming on Voltage DEX is a process that allows you to earn VOLT
      token rewards by providing liquidity to the platform. To get started, you
      need to search and select two tokens that you want to pool together. For
      example, you can choose FUSE and FUSD. 


      Once you have selected the tokens, go to the Farm page and choose the same
      Farm that you entered in the pool. In this case, it would be the FUSE +
      FUSD Farm. By doing this, you are staking your LP (Liquidity Provider)
      tokens in the farm.


      To receive your VOLT token rewards, you need to select the claim button on
      the withdraw tab. The VOLT token rewards are updated every few seconds, so
      you can claim them periodically. 


      If you want to unstake your LP tokens, you can navigate to the withdraw
      tab under the farm and select withdraw at the bottom of the panel. This
      will allow you to remove your liquidity from the farm.


      To find the corresponding pool, go to the Pools page on the left toolbar.
      Here, you can search for and select the pool that matches the tokens you
      have pooled together.


      Yield farming on Voltage DEX is a great way to earn VOLT token rewards by
      providing liquidity to the platform. By following these steps, you can
      start yield farming and maximize your earnings. Remember to connect and
      confirm your wallet before you begin the process.
